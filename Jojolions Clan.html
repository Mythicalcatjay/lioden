<h2>Jojo's Bizarre Adventure Fans of Lioden</h2>
Welcome to Jojolions! We of course are all bonded by one thing, <s>being insufferable</s> liking Jojo and Lioden. This is a great space for everyone from casual fans to the people nutty enough to have Jojo Main males and css! Here we offer semi-frequent raffles, silly clan messages, and some fun forms for chit chatting!

<h2>Rules</h2>
1. <b>Make Sure You Fit!</b> - This is a clan primarily for fans of Jojo who have watched all of the anime and potentially the manga, spin-offs, and miscellaneous adaptations. As such, if you haven't watched or haven't finished the anime you may want to hold off. No one wants to be spoiled!
2. <b>Keep Spoilers Where They Belong!</b> - Anime spoilers are welcome anywhere as long as it's not brand new, but spoilers from the manga have to go into the spoilers thread. No one likes being spoiled, so don't do it!
3. <b>Don't Spam People!</b> -  We're Jojo fans, we are known for "Is that a motherfucking Jojo Reference??" While some people are fine having their den filled with silly little comments. just keep in mind not everyone loves that. People who would be prone to references, be clear if you're ok with it or not and if you like to send them abide by those boundaries.
4. <b>Be Respectful!</b> - This should be a given. Have dignity, man, have dignity!
5. <b>Follow Lioden TOS!</b> - Don't be dong, this should also be a given.
