<h1>Jojolions: Official Jojo-Lion Thread!</h1>

Welcome Jojo's Bizarre Adventure Fans of Lioden!

This thread is dedicated to cataloguing the Jojo-themed lions of Lioden. This list is shared not only in the first messages of the forum, but, shared in the big list on the clan page! It is entirely opt-in, meaning you have to put your king in this thread to be included. 

<h2>Rules:</h2>
<li>
1. Kings only! There's many beautiful themed lions out there, but trying to catalogue all of them is like trying to remember how many breads you've eaten in your life. 
2. Please be a member of the Jojolions clan. Joining's easier then trying to keep a lighter lit for hours, so you might as well if you are a big enough fan to have a Jojo-themed lion!
3. Your king must be a reference to Jojo's Bizarre Adventure. While obviously stands and characters are accepted, that's not the only sort of reference we take! Locations, phenomenon, businesses, events, animals, if it originates from the series or its spin offs, then go for it! If your king is a reference to Araki's other works like Gorgeous Irene or Baoh, that's totally welcome as well!
